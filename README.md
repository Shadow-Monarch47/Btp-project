# Multi-Robot Path Planning 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This Bachelor Thesis Project (BTP) focuses on **Multi-Robot Path Planning**, a key problem in robotics where multiple robots must navigate from start positions to goal positions while avoiding collisions with obstacles and each other.  
The project aims to design and simulate efficient path-planning strategies that ensure **collision-free, optimal, and coordinated robot movement**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a path planning framework for multiple robots
- Avoid inter-robot and obstacle collisions
- Optimize path length and execution time
- Simulate robot movements in a controlled environment

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- Environment modeled as a **grid/map-based workspace**
- Path planning using algorithms such as:
  - A* Algorithm  
  - Artificial Potential Field (APF) *(if applicable)*
- Collision avoidance handled through:
  - Priority-based planning
  - Dynamic obstacle consideration
- Simulation-based evaluation of results

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Simulation environment (custom / grid-based)
- Jupyter Notebook *(if used)*
